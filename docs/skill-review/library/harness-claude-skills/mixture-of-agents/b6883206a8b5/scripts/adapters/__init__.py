"""Vendor adapters for mixture-of-agents external CLIs.

Each adapter handles one CLI's quirks: how to invoke it non-interactively,
how to extract the JSON payload from its output wrapper, how to retry on
schema validation failure, and how to surface errors. Adapters do NOT
import each other -- they are independent so a broken opencode install does
not break codex runs.

Shared helpers (used by all 3 adapters) live at the bottom of this file
so there is no circular-import risk — adapters import from the package,
not from each other.

    Shared by the adapters whose CLIs have no native schema enforcement
    (OpenCode and legacy adapters) — model text may wrap the payload in markdown
    fences or surround it with prose. Strategy, longest-match-first:

      0. Fast path: if the whole (stripped) text is a single JSON object,
         return it. This is the common case (the model output IS the JSON)
         and it works regardless of size — important because the balanced
         scan below is windowed and would otherwise miss a bare object whose
         opening brace falls before the window.
      1. Collect the contents of every ```json ... ``` (or bare ``` ... ```)
         fenced block.
      2. Scan for balanced top-level `{...}` objects, respecting strings and
         escapes so braces inside string literals don't miscount depth.
      3. Try to parse each candidate longest-first, with one conservative
         repair pass for invalid JSON string escapes.
      4. When `required_keys` is provided, reject nested objects that happen
         to parse but are not the requested top-level payload.

    `max_scan` caps the balanced-object scan to the LAST N characters. The
    scan is O(n²) in the worst case and an embedded payload sits near the end
    of the response, so this keeps a multi-hundred-KB tool-use log from
    stalling the parser. Returns None if nothing parses.
